# Loan-Default
This repository utilizes the Credit Risk Dataset available at Kaggle to address a fundamental challenge in the banking sector - assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. The primary objective is to construct a scorecard that evaluates an individual's eligibility for a loan, incorporating the critical factor of default probability. The lower the default probability, the higher the likelihood of loan approval. For instance, applicants with a probability of default less than 0.05% will be classified as 'A' grade, making them highly favored candidates within the banking system.

To compute this essential probability of default, we employ a predictive model, evaluating accuracy through a sophisticated binning and weightage approach. Within the provided Python file, the dataset is meticulously cleaned, and several models are implemented, including Weighted Logistic Regression, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) modeling, and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV). The goal is to discern which model yields the highest accuracy and performance, providing valuable insights into credit risk assessment.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in credit risk analysis and predictive modeling, offering a transparent exploration of the dataset and its applications in the banking sector.
